- look at the implementation of this:
	https://ispc.github.io/

- make variable declaration call
	parseAssignment and seperate nodes?

- think about if i want to use
	unsigned remainder for % operator
	instead of signed as in C

- the returnPointer variable access
	scheme probably doesnt work
	for struct access:
		(foo.pos).y
	it has to be activated recursively!
	what happens in the backend???

- editor support
